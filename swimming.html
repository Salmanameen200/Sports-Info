  <h1 style="color:  rgb(253, 207, 0); font-weight: 700;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p style="color:#fff;">
    Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle. </p> <br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.</p>

<div class="container-fluid mt-5">
<h3 style="color:  rgb(253, 207, 0); font-weight: 700;">HISTORY OF SWIMMING</h3>
<p style="color:#fff;">
    Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible, Beowulf, the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swissâ€“German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read). </p> <br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
    Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.</p> <br>
<p style="color:#fff;">    
    In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. </p><br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until T.W. Burgess made the crossing in 1911. </p><br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892. </p><br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Men's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced freestyle to the Western world. In 1908, the world swimming association, FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed. Women's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the Olympics was the 1922 Women's Olympiad. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952.

  <h3 style="color:  rgb(253, 207, 0); font-weight: 700;">RISKS OF SWIMMING</h3>
    <p style="color:#fff;">
        There are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation. Swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations. </p> <br> <br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Most recorded water deaths fall into these categories: </p> <br>
<li style="color:#fff;">
    Panic occurs when an inexperienced swimmer or a nonswimmer becomes mentally overwhelmed by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning. Occasionally, panic kills through hyperventilation, even in shallow water.
</li> <br>
<li style="color:#fff;">
    Exhaustion can make a person unable to sustain efforts to swim or tread water, often leading to death through drowning. An adult with fully developed and extended lungs has generally positive or at least neutral buoyancy, and can float with modest effort when calm and in still water. A small child has negative buoyancy and must make a sustained effort to avoid sinking rapidly.
</li><br>
<li style="color:#fff;">
    Hypothermia, in which a person loses critical core temperature, can lead to unconsciousness or heart failure.
</li><br>
<li style="color:#fff;">
    Dehydration from prolonged exposure to hypertonic salt waterâ€”or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam in the lungs that restricts breathingâ€”can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest.
</li><br>
<p>
    Blunt trauma in a fast moving flood or river water can kill a swimmer outright, or lead to their drowning.
   </p><br> <br>

    <b style="color:#fff;">Adverse effects of swimming can include:</b> <br>
    <div class="leftpoints" style="padding-left: 50px;">
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Exostosis, an abnormal bony overgrowth narrowing the ear canal due to frequent, long-term splashing or filling of cold water into the ear canal, also known as surfer's ear
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Infection from water-borne bacteria, viruses, or parasites
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Chlorine inhalation (in swimming pools)
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Heart attacks while swimming (the primary cause of sudden death among triathlon participants, occurring at the rate of 1 to 2 per 100,000 participations.
    </li><br>
</div>
</li><br>


    <b style="color:#fff;">Adverse encounters with aquatic life:</b> <br>
    <div class="leftpoints" style="padding-left: 50px;">
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Stings from sea lice, jellyfish, fish, seashells, and some species of coral <br>
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Puncture wounds caused by crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, zebra mussels, stingrays, flying fish, sea birds, and debris
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Hemorrhaging bites from fish, marine mammals, and marine reptiles, occasionally resulting from predation
    </li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
        Venomous bites from sea snakes and certain species of octopus
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Electrocution or mild shock from electric eels and electric rays
    </li><br>
</div>
</li>
<p style="color:#fff;" style="font-weight: 600;"> Around any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the United States. Supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools.</p>
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:  rgb(253, 207, 0); font-weight: 700;">CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT OF SWIMMING</h3>
    <p style="color:#fff;">
        Standard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances. Most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits. </p> <br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Men's swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs. Men's casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. In most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection. </p><br>

<p style="color:#fff;">
Modern women's swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (See bikini). Women's swimwear may also cover the midriff as well. Women's swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular. </p><br>

Different cultures have different standards for swimsuits. In Muslim communities, women may choose to wear Hijab modified swimsuits, sometimes called burkini.
Competitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently. Modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight. There are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender. It is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing. </p><br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Wetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation. Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. The wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming. It provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss. The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia. </p><br>
<p style="color:#fff;">
Some people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming; this is known as skinny dipping. In some European countries public pools have naturist sessions to allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have naturist beaches where one can swim naked. It is legal to swim naked in the sea at all UK beaches. It was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century. Today, skinny dipping can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one. </p><br>

    Ear plugs can prevent water from getting in the ears. </li> <br>
<li style="color:#fff;">
    Noseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose. However, using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause disadvantage, so many competitive swimmer choose not to use one. For this reason, nose clips are primarily used for synchronized swimming and recreational swimming.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Goggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and improve underwater visibility. Tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Swim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water, though they are not entirely watertight.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Kickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Pull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Swimfins are used in training to elongate the kick and improve technique and speed. Fins also build upper calf muscles. Fins provide a significantly greater and more efficient conversion of muscle power to thrust than available from the feet, and allow the powerful leg muscles to be used effectively for propulsion through water. The value of fins as an active aid in the teaching, learning and practice of swimming has long been recognised. In the US, as early as 1947, they were used experimentally to build the confidence of reluctant beginners in swimming, while a 1950 YMCA lifesaving and water safety manual reminded swimming instructors how "flippers can be used to great advantage for treading water, surface diving, towing, underwater searching and supporting a tired swimmer".[34] In 1967, research was conducted on fin use in teaching the crawl stroke.[35] During the 1970s, the so-called "flipper-float" method came into vogue in Europe with the aim of helping beginners learn to swim faster and more safely,</li><br>

    Hand paddles are used to increase resistance during arm movements, with the goal of improving technique and power.</li><br>
     <li style="color:#fff;">
    Finger paddles have a similar effect to handle paddles however due to their smaller size create less resistance. They also help with improving a swimmers 'catch' in the water.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Snorkels are used to help improve and maintain a good head position in the water. They may also be used by some during physical therapy.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Pool noodles are used to keep the user afloat during the time in the water.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Safety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the United States.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Swimming Parachutes are used in competitive training, adding an element of resistance in the water helping athletes to increase power in the strokes central movements.</li><br>
    <li style="color:#fff;">
    Inflatable armbands are swimming aids designed to provide buoyancy for the swimmer which helps the wearer to float.</li><br>
